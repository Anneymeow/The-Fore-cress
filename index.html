<td><h5>The picture shows a tree house which is actually the Fore cress Kitchen built in tree where all the dishes are made.</h5>
<p>The concept of Fore cress is nature and in order to keep it natural the developers of Forecress came up with the idea of having a tree house commercial kitchen. The only difference between the other commercial kitchen and Fore cress kitchen is that it is made up of wood. It runs normally like any normal kitchen would operate. </p></td>
